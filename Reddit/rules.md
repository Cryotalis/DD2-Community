1. Keep posts on topic

All posts must be related to Dungeon Defenders.

--

 2. No NSFW content
---

**All content** (title, articles, video, image, website, etc.) must be **SFW**: **S**afe **F**or **W**ork. Content that is **NSFW**: **N**ot **S**afe **F**or **W**ork, is banned. This rule applies to all posts and comments.

--

 3. Respect your fellow community members
---

Respect other members of the sub, and also the developers when posting or commenting. No harassment, witch-hunting, sexism, racism or hate speech will be tolerated.

During discussion, *attack the argument, not the person*;

* The implicit or explicit usage of derogatory language and racial, homophobic or sexist slurs is not permitted. Avoid using potential offensive or hurtful language.
* Referral to a user's personal information/life during arguments is not allowed.

Report rule-breakers to the mod-team, don't respond in kind. Two ~~lefts~~ wrongs don't make a right!

3.1. Cheating Accusations/Hacking/Exploit Posts are considered witch-hunting and are not allowed.

4. Low-effort post guidelines
---

To keep post standards high and ensure the majority of users enjoy browsing the subreddit, there are a few guidelines we ask users to keep in mind:

*Titles should be clear*

Clearly explain your post in a summative fashion using your title. Users should know what to expect when clicking on your post.

*Spoilers*

Keep spoilers in the description and not in the title of posts. For example, if your post title reveals the outcome of the campaign it will be removed.

*Titles should not be clickbait*

Clickbait titles are a low-effort way to gain attention. If your post title contains the phrases "You won't believe this!" or "More info within!", chances are it falls under this category of low-effort posting.

*Posts should provide room for meaningful discussion*

Every post should be a space for meaningful discussion. While this doesn't mean every post needs to be an discursive essay, posts that don't offer room for meaningful discussion will be removed.

**Examples of disallowed posts:**

* Post with an empty body (no text) or bodies containing only "title", "see above", "DAE?" or any variation thereof.
* Post bodies containing only "TFW", "MFW", or any post with extremely minimal text description.
* Rant based posts which won't provide room for non-inflammatory discussion.

Yes/no answerable posts are not generally permitted. If you have a simple yes/no question it's recommended you simply ask your question in the **#help-chat** of the official [DD2 Discord server](https://discord.me/dd2).
